// Talk about some big problem
// read specs / requirements
// try to come up with a solution... together

// a function that takes arrays
// make sure it is an array
  // Array.isArray(myArray)
//  what if it is not ?  convert ?
  // maybe it is a long string
  // str.split(', ')
  // maybe it is a file
// dont assume the initial freq is zero... it could be some other number
// iterate through all elements of the array
// calculates the sum of all changes/freq

// code the solution


// test the solution
