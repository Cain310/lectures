## Design Patterns

I hope you enjoyed our lecture about the process of writing code and then 
refactoring it to make it better.

I thought the group coding session was very productive as led us to discover a "good idea in software". The code we wrote aligns with a well-documented design pattern called [Fluent Interface by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html). 

At other times I've talked about Cohesion and Coupling as forces that will help you make decisions about how to write better code. The bottom line is that when looking for inspiration about how to refactor a particular piece of software there are endless sources to guide you. Consider this a neverending journey to become a better software developer. 

You would do good to spend some time learning UML as it is the de-facto standard on how object systems are documented. The [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)


You can find [the code we wrote here](https://github.com/jugonzal/lhl-lectures/tree/master/w8-design-patterns)

In particular look at the BST which is where we applied the [Visitor Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) to decouple the various operations that can be performed in the tree, without requiring a single change on the tree itself.


Here you'll find some [Javascript Patterns](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/4-javascript-design-patterns-you-should-know) including the _Module Pattern_.
